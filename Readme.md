WSD
---

Core library, no real use as standalone

Using it
---

- [Data](http://github.com/norman784/wsd-data)
- [Rest](http://github.com/norman784/wsd-rest)

The main goal is to have a library that leverage the rest api comunication, so I ended up with this library.

Why I build this this library?
---

Because here I will expose all the libs that compose WSD, now it is called WSD Rest Api but latter on I will add all the libs that write because I'm lazy to do it every time the same thing, or because my web background doesn't allow me to do the desktop/mobile like development way.
